# Analysis-Image-Algorithm

This toolbox provides various image processing functions implemented in Python.

## Description

This project implements several image processing functions using the NumPy, PIL (Python Imaging Library), and Matplotlib libraries. The functions include:

- Displaying the histogram of an image
- Equalizing the image histogram
- Whitening the image
- Darkening the image
- Inverting the image
- Demonstrating the optimal thresholding process

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- PIL (Python Imaging Library)
- Matplotlib

## Learning Objectives

By working on this project, Python students can learn:

1. Image processing techniques and their underlying concepts.
2. Efficient array manipulation and operations using NumPy.
3. Integration of PIL for image loading and manipulation.
4. Visualization of images and plots using Matplotlib.
5. Implementation of a menu-driven program.
6. Code organization and modularity.
7. GitHub integration and project documentation.
